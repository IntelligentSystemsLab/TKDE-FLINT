# FLINT
A new federated learning framework, FLINT, is proposed to address the dilemmas caused by restricted private data 
and limited computing power resources in the IoT. It is compatible with general federared learning methods, 
and acts as an optimizer of these methods to cost-efficiently train required models in various IoT scenarios.
To be specific, FLINT implements a seminal bi-directional distillation process to guide the updates of 
client-side compact-scale models based on server-side large-scale models.
